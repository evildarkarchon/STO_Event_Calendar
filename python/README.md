# STO_Event_Calendar

Original script created by [/u/OfAuguryDefiant](https://www.reddit.com/user/OfAuguryDefiant) on Reddit

I only test this script on the current version of python, but it **should** be compatible down to python 2.7.

I am also writing a version that uses some of the new features in python >= 3.7, such as type annotations and data classes.
